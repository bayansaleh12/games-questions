Mystery Word Game

Create a Mystery Word game where the computer selects a random word and provides a set of clues to help the player guess the word.

Requirements:

The program should select a random word from a predefined list.

Provide the player with a set of clues about the word. Clues could include the number of letters, the first letter, and other characteristics.

Allow the player to input their guess.

Check if the player's guess is correct. If correct, display a victory message; otherwise, provide additional clues and allow the player to guess again.

Limit the number of attempts for the player.

Display a victory or defeat message at the end of the game.

Ask the player if they want to play again. If yes, select a new random word and start a new game.

Hints:

Use a list of words for the computer to choose from.
Provide different types of clues for the player (e.g., number of letters, first letter, etc.).
Utilize loops for repeated guessing and conditional statements for checking the correctness of each guess.
